%% Construct and Train a Function Fitting Network
% Load the training data.
[x,t] = simplefit_dataset;
% The 1-by-94 matrix |x| contains the input values and the 1-by-94 matrix |t|
% contains the associated target output values.

%% 用默认参数构建网络
% Construct a function fitting neural network with one hidden layer of size
% 10.
net = fitnet(10);
% View the network.
view(net)
% The sizes of the input and output are zero. The software adjusts
% the sizes of these during training according to the training data.
% Train the network |net| using the training data.
net = train(net,x,t);
% View the trained network.
view(net)
% You can see that the sizes of the input and output are 1.
% Estimate the targets using the trained network.
y = net(x);
% Assess the performance of the trained network. The default performance function is mean squared error.
perf = perform(net,y,t)

%% 换成trainbr训练函数

% The default training algorithm for a function fitting network is
% Levenberg-Marquardt ( |'trainlm'| ). Use the Bayesian regularization training algorithm and
% compare the performance results.
net = fitnet(10,'trainbr');
net = train(net,x,t);
y = net(x);
perf = perform(net,y,t)
% The Bayesian regularization training algorithm improves the performance of the network in terms of
% estimating the target values.
